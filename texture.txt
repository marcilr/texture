The bottom line
===============
Texture subscriptions are available at two tiers.  You can subscribe
to either Basic for $9.99/month and Premium for $14.99, with a 30-day
free trial either way.  The key difference is that premium offers
access to a handful of weekly issues, while basic only goes monthly.
I don't typically read magazines so that comes off as a little steep,
but if you already have a handful of subscriptions on the go or purchase
at least two magazines outright a month, it's good value.  In terms of
the quality of the content, there's a wide range of subject matter to
pick from and a lot of big-name publications are on-board.  Once the
collection features from the iOS version find their way over, Texture
will be something really interesting.
